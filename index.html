          <p>Hey there! My name is Emmett Austin this is my first term at PCC. I have been homeschooled since kindergarten with my sister and brother. Some of my favorite subjects were math, particularly the Algebras, coding, the Art of Argument. I took a couple of online boot camps like <a target="_blank" href="https://zerotomastery.io">Zero to Mastery</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com">Hacking with Swift</a> .</p>
          <p>I was taught how to use HMTL 5, CSS 3, java script, bootstrap, express, PostgreSQL, React, npm, node.js GitHub, Heroku production, and CSS grid. My favorite language and section was React. React is so powerful and easy to use. Playing with this HTML reminds me of how for the developer community has come.</p>
          <p>I am reading these questions from the <a target="_blank"href="https://online.pcc.edu/d2l/le/content/461899/viewContent/10042844/View ">assignment 3 instructions page in D2L</a>, so I'll keep going down the list.</p>
          <h2>Movies!</h2>
            <ol class="movieList">
              <li>My favorite movie is Infinity War, but some close runenr ups are:</li>
              <li>Endgame</li>
              <li>Inception</li>
              <li>The Matrix</li>
              <li>Free Guy</li>
            </ol>
          <h2>Vacation</h2>
          <p>My favorite vacation was when my family and I went on a road trip to see Yosemite and El Capitan. We hiked around the area for a few days then went to see the Redwood forest. Dude those trees are awesome!</p>
          <h2>Goal</h2>
          <p>My goal for this class is to get the degree, but I also want to fill in the blanks of my coding knowledge.</p>
